                                     Komodo Option Settings



1. Table Memory: The default value 64 is recommended for blitz games where 

the hash size should be in the 128 to 512 MB range. 128 is recommended for 

intermediate level games such as 15 minutes to one hour per side, where hash 

table size might be one to four GB. For standard games such as two hours per 

side or more we suggest 256 for Table Memory, when hash size is usually 4 GB 

or more. In the TCEC we used 256. 



2. Drawscore. The default value, negative 7, is appropriate when playing 

against most other strong computer programs with the exception of close rivals,

when zero should be best. A larger negative value like -15 is suggested for 

playing against older or much weaker engines or against human Grandmasters. 

Even larger negative values are best for most human opponents, unless you want 

to brag about how you got a draw against Komodo due to a repetition of position 

early in the game! In the TCEC we used the default negative 7 in the first stage, 

gradually reducing to zero for the final.

      

3. Time Usage Aggressiveness: The default zero is considered best when there 

is no lag to worry about, although it is likely that the value is not optimum 

for longer time control games. When playing on a server where there is lag, a 

negative value (-3 is suggested by one of our testers) makes sense to avoid 

lag-induced severe time pressure. For TCEC we used zero. 


4. Move Overhead Milliseconds: Here too the default should be fine on most 

computers and GUIs when there is no lag, but if you discover that the engine 

occasionally forfeits on time on your system try doubling the default. When 

there is server lag a much larger value should be used, one that is somewhat 

larger than the average lag. Thus if lag averages around a tenth of a second 

a setting of 150 might be reasonable. There is some overlap between this parameter 

and the previous one; a large enough setting here might make it unnecessary to 

use a negative value for Time Usage for example. For TCEC we used the default. 



5. The King Table Multiplier (ktabm) parameters are what we believe to be best 

for bullet chess, but it is possible that other values might work better in 

longer games. 



6. Threads: For maximum performance, set the number of threads to match the number 

of cores on your computer, not the number of threads. Modern Intel -based computers 

may have for example 4 cores but 8 threads; set number of Threads to 4, not to 8.
